Module 10 Challenge - Creating an SVP Logo Maker!

## Introduction

For this assignment, I built an application using Node.js that takes in user inputs to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select 3 characters, colors (for both the text and the shape) and a shape itself (square, circle and triangle are the shape choices to choose from). The SVP Logo Maker features inquirer@8.2.4 inside Node.js which is powered by JavaScript.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created a SVP Logo Maker using Node.js that features the following:

When the user is prompted for text, they can enter three characters of their choosing.

When the user is prompted for the text color, they can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).

When the user is prompted for the shape's color, they can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).

When the user is prompted for a shape, they are presented with a list of 3 shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.

After the user has entered the inputs for all the prompts, an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`, and the output text "Created our logo.svg" is printed in the command line.

## References
To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 10-OOP Class Files as references:

"05-Ins_Classes" 

"07-Ins_Inheritance"

"08-Stu_Inheritance" 

"11-Ins_Setup-Jest"

"12-Stu_Setup-Jest"

"19-Ins_TDD"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/rmessett15/SVG-Logo-Maker"

"https://github.com/ThomasCalle/Thomas-Object-Oriented-Programming-SVG-Logo-Maker"

"https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/what-purpose-does-xmlns-http-www-w3-org-2000-svg-version-1-1-serve/277084"

"https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-SVG11-20110816/intro.html#NamespaceAndDTDIdentifiers"

"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Basic_Shapes"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJYMcLus3v0"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in the index.js, shapes.js and the shapes.test.js files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria for our specific assignment. It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
